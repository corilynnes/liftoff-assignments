## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am a huge plant nerd and with my collection getting ever closer to the triple digit mark it is getting harder to keep track of everyone and their wants and needs. For my initial frontend project I wanted to create a plant tracker, then I saw one of the demo projects was a plant tracker, I was worried it would seem like I was just copying the idea.

After adding to my plant collection, this is an app that I truely need myself and I feel like this would also be beneficial to the other plant parents in the groups I participate in.

The main purpose of the app is to create a list of the plant babies you currently own. I have a hard time remembering many of the scientific names as well as what some if these picky butthole needs. So with the Bloom app, I'll be able to create my own profile with my plants and their common and scientific names. I'll be able to add their soil, humidity, and water peferences as well as any other notes. A watering alert will help remind me if someone has gone 2 weeks without watering so I know to double check and see if they are good or are too thristy. I also love supporting local nurseries and would love to be able to have some place to search for them.

editing items in database lists,
animations on front end side,
creating time sensitive alerts,
